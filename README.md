A Node.js application for making a bluetooth low energy GPS devices

This is currently not much more than a science project, but it works well using a Raspberry Pi 2 & Adafruit's Ultimate GPS HAT + external antenna (my test hardware).

Eventually I plan on getting this slimmed down to run on a Raspberry Pi Zero and either continuing to use the ultimate GPS HAT or wiring up just the chip part of the HAT.
